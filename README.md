# VRPplay
Programs that play with passing by Value, passing by Reference, and passing by Pointer.
Programs each do the same thing, take in three numbers and order them from lowest to highest.
Current issue/goal is taking in numbers that are repeats :) 
(for ENGRb19c course)

### 5/1/18 
Used a boolean function to check if there were any repeated numbers entered.
